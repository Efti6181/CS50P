## 🧩 Coursework Exercises

This repository includes coursework exercises completed throughout CS50P to practice and apply Python programming concepts. These materials reflect my personal learning progress and are shared at a high level for educational and portfolio purposes.

**Concepts practiced include:**

* Functions and variables
* Conditionals and loops
* Exception handling
* File I/O
* Regular expressions
* Unit testing with `pytest`
* Object-Oriented Programming



## 🚀 Final Project: Personal Expense Tracker

### 📌 Project Overview

The **Personal Expense Tracker** is a command-line based Python application designed to help users record, manage, and analyze daily expenses. It focuses on simplicity, data persistence, and clean software design while demonstrating essential Python programming skills.

### ✨ Features

* Add expenses with name, category, amount, and automatic date entry
* Persistent data storage using **JSON**
* Automatic data export to **CSV** for spreadsheet analysis
* Calculate total expenses from stored data
* Generate category-wise expense reports in text format
* Modular function-based design
* Automated testing using **pytest**

### 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python 3
* JSON & CSV for data storage
* Pytest for unit testing



## 🧪 Testing

At least three core functions of the final project are tested using `pytest` to ensure correctness and reliability. Automated testing helps maintain code quality and reflects good software development practices.


## 🎥 Project Demo

A video demonstration of the final project is available on YouTube:
